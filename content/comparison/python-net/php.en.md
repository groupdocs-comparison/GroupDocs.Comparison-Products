       GroupDocs.Comparison for Python via .NET serves as an API specifically built for comparing documents and images in various formats. It identifies changes in words, paragraphs, characters, shapes, and style elements between the documents. You can conveniently merge these modifications and save them as a consolidated final document. It supports an extensive array of formats, including PDFs, Word documents, Excel sheets, PowerPoint presentations, Visio, HTML files, images, and much moreâ€”all achieved without third-party tools.

    content: |
      Utilize [GroupDocs.Comparison](https://products.groupdocs.com/comparison/python-net/) to perform detailed comparisons on PHP files.
      
      1. Begin by installing GroupDocs.Comparison for Python via .NET through [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/groupdocs-comparison-net/).
      2. Instantiate a Comparer object with the initial PHP file.
      3. Integrate the second PHP file into the Comparer.
      4. Compile a detailed report delineating all identified discrepancies.
