       GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET is a native .NET API designed for comparing multiple images and documents of the same format. It aids in detecting differences within paragraphs, words, characters, shapes, and even the text styles of the compared documents. With the ability to merge these changes and export to a final document, it supports comparison and merging of PDFs, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, Visio diagrams, Outlook emails, HTML, drawings, and various image file formatsâ€”all without the need for any external libraries.
